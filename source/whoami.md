  I am <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>. I cannot really prove it, but that's not the point. You should be Satoshi Nakamoto too.
  <br><br>
  Well, <b>plebhash</b> is actually a nym. I am a Computer Engineer in my mid-30s. Although Academia is a rotting corpse, I wasted some of my time there so I hold a BSc in Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://www5.usp.br" target="_blank">USP</a> and a MSc in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://ufg.br" target="_blank">UFG</a>. I started my "professional" journey in the Automotive industry, so I have some grasp over Embedded Linux, Systems Programming and Real Time Communication. From 2019 to 2023, I dedicated my time to the so-called "web3" universe, working for the <a href="https://iota.org" target="_blank">IOTA Foundation</a> and later for <a href="https://parity.io" target="_blank">Parity Technologies</a>.

  Nowadays, I'm a grantee with <a href="https://spiral.xyz">Spiral</a> working on <a href="https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum">StratumV2 Reference Implementation</a>, which is a protocol for Bitcoin Mining.
  <br>
  I'm also interested in innovative architectures for Bitcoin Mining Pools, so I'm a casual contributor to <a href="https://github.com/braidpool/braidpool">braidpool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/plebemineira/plebpool">plebpool</a>.
